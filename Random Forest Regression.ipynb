    "Above output is from the Random Forest Regression with the default settings. Currently, according to the Adjusted R Squared Score, the model is not performing well since it has a score of 0.24. In other words, the attributes currently do not predict the ratings very well. The Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error currently don't have much meaning since we don't have other Mean Sqaure Errors and Root Mean Squared Errors to compare them to. So let's try using grid search to see parameters work best for Random Forest Regression."
